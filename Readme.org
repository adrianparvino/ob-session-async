- [[https://github.com/dzop/emacs-jupyter][emacs-jupyter]] enables
  using jupyter kernels with org-babel source blocks, and supports
  async session evaluation. It's an excellent package and I like using
  it, especially with Python. However, there are some situations where
  I'd rather not use jupyter, which lead me to writing this
  package. For example, when using R, I prefer the
  [[https://ess.r-project.org/][ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics)]]
  environment over the jupyter IRkernel.
- [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]] enables async
  evaluation for regular (non-session) org-babel source blocks. It
  does *not* support the =:session= header argument for evaluating
  multiple source blocks in an existing session.
