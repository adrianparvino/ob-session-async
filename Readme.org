- [[https://github.com/dzop/emacs-jupyter][emacs-jupyter]] enables
  using jupyter kernels with org-babel source blocks and supports
  async session evaluation. It's an excellent package and I frequently
  use it with Python. However, there are some settings where I would
  rather not use jupyter -- in particular, when working in R, I prefer
  using the [[https://ess.r-project.org/][ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics)]]
  environment instead, which was my main motivation for writing
  =ob-session-async=.
- [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]] enables async
  evaluation for regular (non-session) org-babel source blocks. It
  does not support the =:session= header argument for evaluating
  multiple source blocks in an existing session.
